# Hello, beautiful. 

If you see this, it means you're either stalking my github account, or you are using my pc while I'm at work, you sneaky little weasel.

But that's okay, I forgive you <3

This is a work in progress, for you in particular, but you are free to take a looksie if you wish. All I ask is that you don't actually scan my code, and instead just run the program.

This is a treasure hunt. There's hints in the code which would ruin the experience ): So please avoid spoiling yourself and saddening me (â—žâ€¸â—Ÿ)

Keep in mind, the project is still at the beginning, so I haven't even set the paths yet. Have patience, you tosser.


## Here's a detailed summary of how this project came to fruition (: 

&gt;be me.

&gt;bored at work on the 15th of August 2025.

&gt;get macbook out to find some movie to waste time on.

&gt;remember that I had a folder with movies already, gained via the arr matey route

&gt;but forgot where folder is

&gt;sigh

&gt;start rummaging through files

&gt;looking through coding folders

&gt;see 'fun-thingy'

&gt;opened the bastard and ran it

&gt;instant flashbacks

&gt;I still remember writing the code

&gt;memories flood back

&gt;took off my rings and started typing

&gt;I am so smart

&gt;worked more in 2 hours at my boring government job than I did in a month at my old techie job

&gt;showed a coworker my custom javascript to brag

&gt;he said I'm smart

&gt;get happy feelings

### 2 days later

&gt;weekend passes, it's Monday, I'm back at work

&gt;pull up macbook and start click-clacking at the keyboard

&gt;looking on codepen for inspiration

&gt;find cyberpunk UI, very minimal and static

&gt;something... something... JS(Babel)

&gt;get crazy idea

&gt;modify it in its entirety, keeping fuck-all but some of the css

&gt;it's mostly javascript

&gt;flex muscles and push through

&gt;end of day arrives, pack my stuffs and skidoodle home

### 1 day later

&gt;get to work somewhat happy

&gt;go to the program

&gt;see js again

&gt;tears.jpeg

&gt;power through again

### 1 day later

&gt;back at work

&gt;reach 950 lines in one of my js files

&gt;I stare into the abyss as I imagine the day I will have to despaghettise my code

&gt;pack up and go home

&gt;at home:

&gt;decide I wanna keep working, only to realise I haven't git pushed

&gt;see that I didn't even make the repo, must've dreamt it

&gt;ughhhh.png

&gt;open terminal, type the crap, be done with it

&gt;start writing bullsht in the README

### Present time

So now I'm here. Lil coding beginner making you a fun lil game. I'm especially proud of the cyberpunk page, but I SINCERELY wouldn't want to do that again. So tangled. So yucky. But the page looks pretty âœ¨chicâœ¨

First thing to type is 'IDENTITY', and keep an eye out for Helper (:

Kisses, hugs & smooches, bugs ð–¢¥
      
~Your girlfriend <3
